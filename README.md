# Home Breuw

# WARNING! THIS PROJECT IS STILL **VERY** WIP, AND MANY THINGS WILL BE BROKEN. PLEASE DONT REPORT ISSUES BEFORE THE TOOL IS UP ON GAMEBANANA! Thanks!

Hi! If you are reading this then you are probably a dev. If not, please go to the GameBanana pa(i)ge for Home Breuw for better user info.

## development
you need all the prerequisites listed [here](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) and **bun** (recommended, though if you want to use node or deno go for it).

to install packages run;
```
bun i
```
and to run the app;
```
bun run tauri dev
```

issues (and pull requests if you really want) are "allowed" :D (as if they ever weren't allowed).
